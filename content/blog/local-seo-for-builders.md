Local SEO for builders requires a combination of Google Business Profile optimization, local landing pages, and citations targeted to city audiences.

## 1. Google Business Profile
Make sure the profile is verified, categories are correct, and you collect reviews.

## 2. City Landing Pages
Create dedicated pages per city like "Real estate consultant in Mumbai" with useful local content.

## 3. Structured Data
Use JSON-LD for Organization and LocalBusiness, and add FAQ schema where relevant.
